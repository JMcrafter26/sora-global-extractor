### Example Usage

To use the global extractor, you need to copy the `global_extractor.js` file to your Sora module and modify youre `extractStreamUrl` function to use the global extractor.

The global extractor has a placeholder for the `extractStreamUrl` function. 
You will need to get the stream Urls from your site and pass them to the global extractor in an array like this:

```javascript
// You will need to get the stream Urls yourself 
// and put them in the providers object like this:
providers = {
  "https://vidmoly.to/embed-preghvoypr2m.html": "vidmoly",
  "https://speedfiles.net/40d98cdccf9c": "speedfiles",
  "https://speedfiles.net/82346fs": "speedfiles",
};

let streamUrl = null;
try {
  streamUrl = globalExtractor(providers);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Global extractor error:" + error);
  return null;
}
```


You can find these extractors in action in the [Sora Modules Library](https://sora.jm26.net/library).
